##### Introduction

The folder contains some interesting programs. Some of them may be useful in the daily life. Most of them are written in Java, one of my favorite programming languages. Others may be written in Python, C++ and so on.

I am not very good at Java. But, it's the first OOP languages I have learned, also, learned by myself.

In the autumn of 2017, I have a lot of time to do what I'm interested in, because I'm a senior student. I chose to learned Java by myself and bought a reference book named "Crazy Java" written by Li Gang. I loved this book so much and read it very seriously. It was this book that make me realize the basics of object-oriented. And it also helped me learned C++ in a very short time.

I still have a lot to say. But, so much for this. If you are interested, I will told you the stroy of my way of learning programming when I'm not lazy anymore  :)

##### Run
I edit the code in the IDE of eclipse with Java JDK8, but, I have uploaded only source codes of the project. So, if you want to run it in other IDE, you need to copy these files to the path of "src". 

If you have only installed the Java JDK, you can use the command to run the program. Using "javac" to compile the code, the class file will generate. And then, using "java" to run the main class. Like this:

```
javac main_class.java
java main_class
```
"main_class" refers to the main class of the java.
